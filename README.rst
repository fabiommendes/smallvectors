`smallvectors` is a lightweight library that implements linear algebra operations
in low dimensions. These objects were create to be used in a game engine, but
may be useful elsewhere.

Includes:
    * Vector, point and direction types
    * Arbitrary shape matrix types and some specialized matrices
    * Affine transforms
    * Quaternions
