Description: `smallvectors` is a lightweight library that implements linear algebra operations
        in low dimensions. These objects were create to be used in a game engine, but
        may be useful elsewhere.
        
        Includes:
            * Vector, point and direction types
            * Arbitrary shape matrix types and some specialized matrices
            * Affine transforms
            * Quaternions
