Description: `smallvectors` is a lightweight library that implements linear algebra operations
        in low dimensions. These objects were create to be used in a game engine, but
        may be useful elsewhere.
        
        The library has an opt-in process for optimizing code with C-extensions written
        in Cython. The optimized version of the library is one of the fastest Python
        packages for low dimensional linear algebra operations.
        
        Small vectors supports:
            * Vector, point and direction types
            * Arbitrary matrices and some specialized ones (square matrices, unitary
              matrices, rotational matrices, etc).
            * Affine transforms
            * Quaternions
