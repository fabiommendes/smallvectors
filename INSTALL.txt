Dependencies
============

`smallvectors` can run in many Python implementations including CPython and 
PyPy. In CPython it can be installed as a (slow) pure-python version or it
can use compiled extensions to speed-up things in C. This is done using Cython 
and it is highly recommended that a C compiler and Python development headers 
are installed prior to building the `smallvectors` library. The speed-ups can 
be dramatic.

The library depends on the `pygeneric` and `six` packages available at PyPI.


Installation commands
=====================

If you downloaded a compressed package, simply unpack it and execute the 
regular Python install::

    $ python setup.py build
    $ sudo python setup.py install

This package is also available at PyPI and hence can be installed using `pip`::

    $ sudo pip install smallvectors

This is the recommended way since it automatically install all dependencies.

In Windows the command would be something like this (adapt for the correct 
Python installation path)::

    $ cd c:\python34
    $ python -m pip install smallvectors
